# Project Description
## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a Food Delivery Mobile Application developed using Java and Android Studio. The application was created as part of the COMP2008 module coursework at Curtin University in 2022. It's designed to offer a platform for users to browse multiple local restaurants, explore their menus, and order food items conveniently from their mobile devices.

## Purpose
The Food Delivery Mobile Application acts as a customized platform for restaurants to connect directly with their customers without relying on external delivery services like Uber Eats or Menulog. It offers an intuitive interface for customers to view available restaurants, explore menus, and place food orders hassle-free.

## Key Functionalities
> Restaurant Scroll: Users can scroll through a list of restaurants, each accompanied by their respective images, allowing seamless exploration.

> Food Item Selection: Enables users to browse food items available at selected restaurants with images, descriptions, and prices.

> Order Management: Users can add selected food items to their order bucket, specifying the number of servings they desire.

>Checkout and Editing Orders: Allows users to proceed to checkout, review orders, and edit or remove items before finalizing their purchase.

> User Authentication: Requires users to login or register during checkout, ensuring security and storing order history.

> Order History: Logged-in users can view their order history, including details such as order time, costs, restaurant names, and food items.

> Dynamic Home Page: Upon app launch, a 'Today's Special Menu' is displayed, showcasing random food items from different restaurants.

## Database Technology
> SQLite Database: All application information, excluding images, is stored in an SQLite database. The database schema and entries include restaurant data, food items, prices, and references to respective images.

## Device Testing 
> Device Testing: The application is tested on both a phone and a tablet (larger than 8 inches), ensuring compatibility and a responsive layout.
